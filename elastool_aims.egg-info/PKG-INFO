# ElasTool_aims

A modified version of ElasTool for it to work with FHI-aims.

Below is the original version of the README.

# ElasTool

**ElasTool** (*Elastic Analysis and Simulation Toolkit for Optimized Observations and Learning*) is a powerful and innovative Python-based toolkit optimized for computing the second-order elastic constants (SOECs) and mechanical properties of crystal systems across different dimensions, including 3D structures, 2D materials, coaxially rolled 2D-based van der Waals nanostructures, and 1D nanotubes. It harnesses first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics, making it ideal for analyzing both zero-temperature and finite-temperature conditions.


##  About ElasTool

ElasTool offers a flexible approach to determining elastic constants and mechanical properties of various materials at zero and finite temperatures and pressures, providing a broad scope of utility across different material conditions. It seamlessly integrates with the VASP electronic structure code. However, its architecture is open and can easily implement interfaces to other DFT packages. If you are interested in such extensions, please don't hesitate to contact the authors for further guidance and support with the ElasTool source code. The software utilizes three kinds of strain-matrix sets: High-Efficiency Strain-Matrix Sets (OHESS), Universal Linear-Independent Coupling Strains (ULICS), and All-Single-Element Strain-Matrix Sets (ASESS) [1], enabling automatic and efficient calculation of the SOECs.

- Required files:
  - `massdensity_dim.dat` for material's dimension and mass density.
    ```
    # Mass density in Kg/m^2, Dimension
    0.00000224 2D
    ```
  - `elastic_tensor.dat` for the elastic tensor matrix.
    ```
    # Elastic tensor in Voigt notation for 2D material
    52.2849 28.6494 0.0000
    28.6494 36.5780 0.0000
    0.0000 0.0000 22.8516
    ```

### Post-Processing Capabilities
To utilize ElasTool's post-processing features:
1. Set up the `massdensity_dim.dat` and `elastic_tensor.dat` files as described.
2. Use the following terminal commands (case insensitive):
    ```
    elastool -pp
    elastool -Postprocess
    elastool -postprocess
    elastool -POSTPROCESS
    ```
3. For interactive web plots with Plotly, add `-plotly`:

These features enhance the user experience by simplifying the analysis process and providing intuitive, accessible data visualizations directly from ElasTool's interface.


## Installation

ElasTool offers straightforward installation options suitable for various user preferences. These methods ensure a hassle-free setup, allowing you to commence your material science investigations with ElasTool promptly. Detailed instructions can be found in the INSTALL file, but here are the general methods:

1. **Using pip**:
   - Quickly install ElasTool with pip by executing: 
     ```
     pip install -U elastool
     ```

2. **From Source Code**:
   - Alternatively, download the source code with:
     ```
     git clone [git@github.com:gmp007/elastool.git] or git clone [git@github.com:zhongliliu/elastool.git] 
     ```
   - Then, install ElasTool by navigating to the master directory and running:
     ```
     pip install .
     ```

3. **Installation via setup.py**:
   - As an alternative, ElasTool can be installed using the `setup.py` script:
     ```
     python setup.py install [--prefix=/path/to/install/]
     ```
   - The optional `--prefix` argument is useful for installations in environments like shared High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, where administrative privileges might be restricted.
   - Please note that while this method remains supported, its usage is gradually declining in favor of more modern installation practices. It is recommended primarily for specific scenarios where standard installation methods like `pip` are not applicable.

     
## Usage and Running ElasTool

Learning to use ElasTool is made easy with the provided examples in the example folder. Here are the key steps for using ElasTool effectively:
